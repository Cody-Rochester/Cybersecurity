PICKLE RICK CTF

This Rick and Morty-themed challenge requires you to exploit a web server and find three ingredients to help Rick make his potion and transform himself back into a human from a pickle.

Deploy the virtual machine on this task and explore the web application: 10.10.212.184

My first step was to enter the url 10.10.212.184 into my web browser to check on any initial information because there was minimal context given in the prompt.
