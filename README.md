## CTF Challenges
Explore my solutions to various Capture The Flag challenges. These projects demonstrate my problem-solving skills, and proficiency in exploiting vulnerabilities to achieve specific goals. Each challenge is an opportunity for me to enhance my cybersecurity expertise and share my insights with the community.

- [Pickle Rick CTF](https://github.com/Cody-Rochester/Cybersecurity/blob/main/Tryhackme/Pickle%20Rick%20CTF.md) - TryHackMe's exciting Rick and Morty-themed challenge involving web exploitation to help Rick transform back from a pickle. Check out the step-by-step process and key takeaways in the project documentation.


## Home Lab Projects
Embark on a journey through my home lab experiments, where I simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios, set up security infrastructure, and fine-tune defensive mechanisms. These projects illustrate my practical knowledge in creating secure environments for testing and learning.

- [Sentinel Live Attacks Heat Map SIEM Lab](https://github.com/Cody-Rochester/Cybersecurity/blob/main/Home%20Labs/Sentinel_Live_Attacks_Heat_Map_SIEM_Lab/README.md) - Take a look at my honeypot VM set up in Azure. I utilize Azure VM, Logs Analytics Workspace, Sentinel, and a PowerShell script to create a heat map including the locations of the RDP Brute Force attempts coming in from all over the world.

- [Active Directory Home Lab](https://github.com/Cody-Rochester/Cybersecurity/blob/main/Home%20Labs/Active%20Directory%20Home%20Lab.md) - Join me in setting up a simulated corporate AD environment. The end result is an AD Domain with 1,000+ users that can access the internet through a NAT. One VM is running the domain controller on a Windows 2019 Server, and the other is simulating any of the 1,000 end-users on a Windows 10 Desktop VM.

- [Keylogger with Email Output](https://github.com/Cody-Rochester/Cybersecurity/tree/main/Home%20Labs/Keylogger%20with%20Email%20Output) - Explore an element of digital surveilance with this C# keylogger. It functions as a typical keylogger and also has built in email output.
