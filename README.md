## CTF Challenges
Explore my solutions to various Capture The Flag challenges. These projects demonstrate my problem-solving skills, cryptography knowledge, and proficiency in exploiting vulnerabilities to achieve specific goals. Each challenge is an opportunity for me to enhance my cybersecurity expertise and share my insights with the community.

- [Pickle Rick CTF]([#](https://github.com/Cody-Rochester/Cybersecurity/blob/main/Tryhackme/Pickle%20Rick%20CTF.md)) - An exciting Rick and Morty-themed challenge involving web exploitation to help Rick transform back from a pickle. Check out the step-by-step process and key takeaways in the project documentation.

- [Binary Reversing Challenge](#) - Delve into the world of binary reversing as I dissect and solve a challenging CTF challenge, showcasing my skills in reverse engineering.

## Home Lab Projects
Embark on a journey through my home lab experiments, where I simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios, set up security infrastructure, and fine-tune defensive mechanisms. These projects illustrate my practical knowledge in creating secure environments for testing and learning.

- [Network Security Configuration](#) - Explore my home lab's network security configuration, where I implement firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other protective measures to enhance overall network resilience.

- [Active Directory Home Lab]([#](https://github.com/Cody-Rochester/Cybersecurity/blob/main/Home%20Labs/Active%20Directory%20Home%20Lab.md)) - Join me in setting up a simulated corporate AD environment. The end result is an AD Domain with 1,000+ users that can access the internet through a NAT. One VM is running the domain controller on a Windows 2019 Server, and the other is simulating any of the 1,000 end-users on a Windows 10 Desktop VM.
